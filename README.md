## Red Button

Upon loading the website, press the red button to begin the process of generating a randomized password based on criteria the user selects.

## Prompts

Once the user select the red button to beging the process, they will be presented wiith multiple promots (questions) that will help define the random password.
User is required to selcted a password length betwen 8-128 characters. 
If a valid input is not entered, the prompt will end automatically. If a valid input is entered, the prompt will continue to the next question.
Once all questions are answered, a random password will be generated based on the criteria the user selected.
The password will display in the text box field for the user to capture.

* There is also a option in the code that is commented out currently that allows the prompt to repeat itself until the user enters valid data. This was removed as it lowers the user experience and keeps them in a loop if user does not select valid data.
* This feature can be tested by, commenting out lines 25-39 on the script.js sheet. You will then comment in the lines 45-62 (While Loop).

## Test
There a several test setup throughout the code to ensure it is working without error. You can test this by using the console.log(s) that are setup throughout the code.
These can be found on the following lines of code in script.js: 23, 47, 86, 106, 114, and 117.
